#July 2016- conntinuing work on NLP and TM in CompMusic this summer
1. reorganized previous stuff from Mar 2016, and committed some important stuff to GitHub
2. Now I will need to do some manual corrections on segmentation. I will do this on the repo and commit my changes to the remote GitHub repo. This will be done in the banshi-data/bs4_all_docs dir, and working on the 4 banshi files. Notice that before, there are many different copies of the lyrics split up in different ways, most of them auto-segmented by CoreNLP. Now I am working on this version of four files for this corpus after reading PTB Chinese segmentation guideline.
